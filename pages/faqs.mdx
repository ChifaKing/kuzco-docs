Kuzco will run better on systems with better GPUs, producing more tokens/second, and ultimately earning you more **$KZO** points. As such, `Mac M3 Max chips`, and `NVIDIA 4090` and `A100` cards are great for running Kuzco.

These systems should also have at least **30GB of free disk space**.

## Getting an `Illegal Instruction (core dumped)` error?

As of the **31st of March 2024**, one of the most common causes of this error for Kuzco is a disabled set of CPU instructions in your BIOS or Hypervisor often enforced by your hosting provider. These are commonly the `avx`, `avx2`, or `fma` instruction sets.

What to do when receiving this error?

1. **Determine if these instruction sets are disabled on your device with the following commands.**

For Mac: `sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu`

For Linux: `lscpu | grep Flags`

Look for `avx`, `avx2`, and `fma`. If one of them is missing, this is one of the most probable cause of the error.

2. **Enable these instruction sets on your device.**

Generally, these flags are enabled via the `BIOS` or `Hypervisor` settings, both of which are daunting and critical.

We recommend the following courses of action:
- Spin a new one to see if that eliminates the error.
- Get your provider to enable these instructions sets for you
- Find a new hosting provider that supports these instruction sets

If all of the above fails and you're persistent on using your current device setup, [Open a support ticket](https://discord.gg/kuzco) and we'll see what we can do.
