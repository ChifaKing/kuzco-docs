For optimal performance, we recommend using a system with at least 16 GB of RAM and/or a GPU with 16 GB of VRAM.

## Optimal System Requirements

Kuzco will run better on systems with better GPUs, producing more tokens/second, and ultimately earning you more **$KZO** points. As such, `Mac M3 Max chips`, and `NVIDIA 4090` and `A100` cards are great for running Kuzco.

These systems should also have at least **30GB of free disk space**.
