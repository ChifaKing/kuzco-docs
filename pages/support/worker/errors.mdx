## `NatsError: TIMEOUT`

Kuzco is currently under **heavy development** to bring you a more stable and reliable experience. This error means that the network is currently intermittent.

A common resolution is to wait as the **Kuzco team investigates and work on eliminating the cause of these instabilities**.

## `ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR: Failed to get cpu information`

This error is caused by a Kuzco unsupported chipset, which the Kuzco community <Link href="/support/worker/faqs"> commonly experiences with AMD chips</Link>.
