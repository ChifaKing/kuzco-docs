## `NatsError: 503`, `TypeError: Load failed`, `NatsError: CONNECTION_CLOSED`

Kuzco is currently under **heavy development** to bring you a more stable and reliable experience. This error means that the network is currently intermittent.

A common resolution is to wait as the **Kuzco team investigates and work on eliminating the cause of these instabilities**.

After the Kuzco team resolves the problem, restart your worker with `sudo kuzco worker start`.
